PROMPT:

"Hernan Diaz’s In the Distance is interested in the boundary between capitalist rationality
and its outside or antithesis. Write an essay that examines how the novel makes this
distinction vivid. How, in other words, does Diaz bring into relief the effect of
commodity culture—and the related ideologies of property and possession—on
individuals and social relations? And how, simultaneously, does he gesture toward
alternative ways of being in or imagining the world?"

-------------------------------
Defining Capitalist Rationality
-------------------------------
Defining rationality
	- my own definition should suffice
	- Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, 
		capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system, and competitive markets

Defining Capitalist rationality
	- Foucault's quote
	- associated reality of Capitalism extends beyond the market
		- hinting at Scott reference
		- keyword: "accumulation"
			- Capitalism cannot afford stagnation
			- At war with Wilderness
			
Nuanced difference between capitalism and "capitalist rationality"


-------------
Boundary Zone
-------------
    - transition into Wilderness
    - defining the space between capitalist rationality and pure Wilderness
    - nature of authority



----------------------------------------
Authority's Relationship with Capitalism
----------------------------------------
Capitalism extends beyond just the markets
	- https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/07-037.pdf
	- briefly explain Scott's abstract

When the degree of authority diminishes, the relationship between capitalism and authority changes
	- Force as a means of coercion becomes Scott's 2nd and 3rd levels
		- Social Contract breaks down
		- Force is itself a type of capital
		- Lorimer's economic relationship with paid hires
			- Contract could be broken if revolt 
			- not absolute: potential for breakdown of relations
				- e.g. relationship with Indians worked out fine
		- Brennan's losing their land
		- 
		
Maybe: Spectrum of Political Anarchism vs. Statism

----------------------------
The Antithesis of Capitalism
----------------------------
Easy answer: Communism
	- this is only a partial antithesis
	- opposite of an Capitalism as an economic system
	
...But if we cannot separate Capitalism from a the state and society...
	- thought experiment, the antithesis of New York City is not the Soviet Bloc
		- both are the product of the "human demension"
			- idea 10:04 pp. 107 

The antithesis of Capitalism is Wilderness // new PP?
	- "outside" of Capitalism 
	- this makes the boundary zone much more accessible
		- e.g. Hakaan feeling the need to get out of society
	- not to say the opposite of Capitalism is emptiness
		- "Hakaan...had always thought that these vast territories were empty" (98)
	- Solitute - capitalism is impossible in a system of one individual
		
Define Wilderness
	- use my essay?

----------------------------------
Capitalism as a Sensory Experience
----------------------------------
"the stench of civilization hit him like a solid mass" (126)

"the dusty stripes abolished the sense that the plains were infinite. There was now..." (198)

"For a while, he sat on his horse amid the tumult and the din, stunned." (264)
	- 

-------------------------
The Boundary Through Time
-------------------------
Capitalism has proven to be a slow march forward
	- I say "proven" because I haven't seen much evidence to the contrary
		- the Wilderness hasn't won any land back
